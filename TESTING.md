## Testing
- [JSHint - Code Analysis Tool](https://jshint.com/) - used to help detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code.
- [W3C - Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) - used to check the markup validity of the HTML documents.
- [W3C - CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - used to check the validity of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). 
  Had several Parse Errors but these seem to be caused by my use of CSS variables. Found the following link which explained more why I
  got the errors. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57661659/w3c-css-validation-parse-error-on-variables)
- [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) - used to help check the responsiveness of the site and also use of Audits to test for performance, accessibility, best practices & SEO

## Testing elements and functionality of all game screens (manually tested)

## Automated tests (using Jasmine)
Jasmine was used to create Test Driven Development for the high score table.
This seemed to go well, although I think the testing script will now be out-of-date.

## Additional Testing
1. Asked friends and family to play the game on their phone, tablets and desktops where possible and let me know
any issues. Got good feedback, with no real issues.
2. I have tested the site on a desktop using the following modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Edge. As well as 
testing on Android phone/tablet and Apple iPhone.
3. The game has not been written to work on Internet Explorer, the user will receive an error suggesting they use a
more modern browser. In the real World if a client wanted a site to work on IE then that is fine, but a lot of
the newer methods of coding Javascript, etc does not work on IE. IE has had it's day and I wanted to code the game
using some of these newer methods.
